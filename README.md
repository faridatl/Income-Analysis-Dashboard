# Income-Analysis-Dashboard

Welcome to the Income Analysis Dashboard repository! üí∞üìä

## Overview

The Income Analysis Dashboard includes various visualizations to help understand the financial performance of a company. This tool is ideal for financial analysts, business managers, and stakeholders looking to monitor and improve the financial health of their organization. The dashboard's interactivity allows for detailed exploration of financial data, making it a valuable asset for strategic planning and analysis.

**Note on Confidentiality**
The PBIX file, being proprietary, will not be shared publicly to protect sensitive project details. The company name has been excluded from the dashboard as well. However, I've included a variety of dashboard images in the repository to provide a glimpse into the dashboard's aesthetics and functionality.

**Note on Data**
The year 2024 only has the first 6 months of income data reported.

## üîç Features

**Proprietary Data Visualization:** The analytics presented on this dashboard are generated from proprietary information, ensuring confidentiality and security. While the Power BI file (PBIX) containing the raw data and configurations won't be made public, I'm excited to share dashboard images to demonstrate the creative aspects, design proficiency, and analytical competence involved in this project.

**Interactive Elements:**  Dive into the analytics with interactive filters and buttons that allow users to customize their view. This includes being able to filter by month, year and company service/product in order to enhance the user experience and facilitate deeper analysis.

**Stimulating Visuals:** Beyond mere data representation, I've focused on developing visually stimulating graphics. The visuals are not just informative but are crafted to engage users and facilitate a better understanding of the company's financial standing.
